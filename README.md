The overall work of me is ,first write a UART program in which you are sending data (string) at the destination port. This UART is generally used in keyboard, mouse, etc. UART stands for universal asynchronous receiver / transmitter and is a simple, two-wire protocol for exchanging serial data.The more information is given by "https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/cz/products/test-and-measurement/essentials-test-equipment/digital-oscilloscopes/understanding-uart_254524.html#:~:text=UART%20stands%20for%20universal%20asynchronous%20receiver%20%2F%20transmitter%20and%20is%20a,both%20sides%20of%20the%20connection."
Asynchronous means no shared clock, so for UART to work, the same bit or baud rate must be configured on both sides of the connection. For choosing buad rate ,you have to know the clock frequency of device ,it is 16 MHz.
the UART function is written in uart.c and uart.h, the function uses timer , I use TIMER2  in my function, so it is written in  timer.c with header file in timer.h. there are two function , Delay_ms() and Delay_us(),which are create delay in milisecond and microsecond respectively.

The doc : "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0l4cMFl-Auo7-HpqH78_K5mvYUA42Em3one0gEC7Lo/edit?tab=t.0" is having some details of programing of DTH11 working, their some diagram of data movement between sensor and the MCU. The circuit diagram is also included in the doc.
